I wrote my first lines of CSS sometime in the early 2000s, experimenting with the `background-image` property on my MySpace page, when I learned something that remains true today: front-end is fun!

Today I'm building software at the OCC, the world's largest options clearinghouse. However, I also love to write, and this website is where the two interests intersect, and where I explore topics in front-end development generally, and React, JavaScript, CSS, and WordPress in particular.
