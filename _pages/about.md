I wrote my first lines of HTML sometime in the early 2000s when I created my first website on AOL Hometown. I would get my first taste of CSS soon after, while experimenting with the `background-image` property on my MySpace.

In other words, I got into front-end for one reason: it's fun.

Today I'm building software at Rantizo, a Drones-as-a-Service company. However, I also love to write, and this website is where the two interests intersect, and where I explore topics in front-end development generally, and React, JavaScript, CSS, and WordPress in particular.
